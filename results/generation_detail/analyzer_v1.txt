    "review": "Stopped by this bakery hoping for some decent desserts but was disappointed by the whole experience. The place isn't wheelchair accessible which is a problem, and they don't even offer WiFi for customers. Their hours are inconsistent - closed on Mondays and limited weekend availability makes it hard to actually visit. The staff seemed disorganized and the service was slow. For a bakery that does catering, you'd expect better customer service and basic amenities."

Great spot for dinner with friends - we sat outside which was nice. Good value for the price and portions were generous."

Family Eyecare really lives up to their stellar reputation - the staff was incredibly thorough during my exam and took the time to explain everything. I love that they're appointment-only because it means no waiting around, and the parking situation is so convenient with their lot right there. Definitely my go-to spot for all things vision-related now!"

    "review": "This place served its purpose as a neighborhood bar and grill, nothing more, nothing less. The food was standard American fare - not terrible, but nothing to write home about either. The atmosphere was casual and the staff was friendly enough, though service could be slow during busy times. I can see why it eventually closed, as it never really found its identity beyond being just another generic sports bar."

The rainbow backlighting looks nice and the keys feel solid. Battery life has been good so far, though I wish the lighting effects were more customizable. Overall a decent wireless gaming keyboard for the price point."
