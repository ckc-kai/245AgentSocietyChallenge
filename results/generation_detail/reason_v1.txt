The location in South Philly was convenient with decent parking options. It's a shame to see another local restaurant close its doors."

Their hours are reasonable for working people, and the fact they've maintained a perfect 5-star rating suggests good customer service. While I haven't made a purchase yet, the positive reviews from other customers give me confidence this would be a good place to shop for a new mattress."

The interface is clean and the four reverb types cover most studio needs effectively. However, the iLok requirement adds an extra layer of complexity and cost that feels outdated in 2024. At $245, it's a decent investment for serious producers, but there are more convenient alternatives available."

The storyline about solving a kidnapping mystery provides good motivation to keep playing, and having two difficulty modes makes it accessible to different skill levels. The mini-games add nice variety to break up the hidden object scenes, but some of the graphics feel a bit dated."
